## Conclusion:

In conclusion, based on the data analysis conducted, several key points have been identified to inform the next car sales strategy:

1. **Regional Focus on Western Australia:** The western region, particularly Western Australia, shows a high level of car consumer interest. Focusing marketing efforts in this area could lead to increased income compared to other regions.
2. **Opportunities with European Luxury Brands:** European car brands like Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi demonstrate strong consumer interest, despite their higher price tags. Effectively marketing these brands could lead to a significant revenue boost.
3. **Strategic Focus on Toyota:** Toyota holds a dominant position in total car sales revenue. Focusing on Toyota for subsequent sales could be beneficial due to its established market presence and consumer interest.
4. **Emphasis on Higher-Performance Cars:** Vehicles with higher performance and luxury features offer potential for increased revenue due to their higher average selling prices. However, aligning this strategy with market demand is crucial.
5. **Determine Car Criteria:** Analysis reveals correlations between factors such as transmission type, fuel type, car body type, number of doors, and seats with car sales prices. Identifying the most effective criteria and focusing sales efforts on cars that meet these criteria can optimize revenue generation.

By integrating these approaches, Automotive Sales can maximize the opportunity to achieve a 40% increase in sales within 6 months. It's essential to remain flexible and ready to adjust strategies based on market responses and evolving trends for sustained success.
